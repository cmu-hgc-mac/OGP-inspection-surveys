* No notes for frontside inspection; this program is going to be replaced with the RPi on the mini gantry. This program takes pictures of every wire bonding area before or after wire bonding.
* Backside inspection is only used when pictures need to be taken on the backside, which is very rare (i.e. unusual bonding pads, large offsets, unidentified debris, etc).

* Tutorials are under Training and require a test piece provided from QVI.
* Additionally, [reticles such as this one](https://www.amazon.com/Microscope-Micrometer-Calibration-TCM-H-Resolution/dp/B00KKSFK2A/) can be useful for learning how to use the OGP and to check the calibration.
* Spreadsheets are input files for find offsets. These contain coordinates for baseplate tray pins compared to the Top Left and Top Right fiducials.
